Actually, simpler: 'Back' reverses 'DOOR' to 'ROOD', then 'fencing yard' means ROOD contains Y, giving R-O-O-D around Y = DROOPY. Wait - let me reconsider: 'Back DOOR' = ROOD (reversal), then 'fencing Y' means Y is fenced/contained, giving DROO(Y)P...

(4) Insert Y into ROOD: DR-O-O-D becomes DROO-P-Y = DROOPY. (5) The definition 'weak and sagging' confirms this is correct, as droopy means exactly that.
