# Clue Factory Project Manifest

## Current Architecture
- **Logic Tier (Sonnet):** Handles mechanics (Wordplay + Definition).
- **Surface Tier (Haiku):** Generates "Minimalist Lies"—thematic, deceptive surfaces with zero filler.
- **Auditor Tier:** Enforces Ximenean grammar, imperative indicators, and fodder integrity.

## The "Minimalist Lie" Strategy
- **Definition:** A surface that reads as a single, natural English thought while using the absolute minimum words necessary to hide the mechanics.
- **Connectivity:** Use only valid cryptic links (e.g., "is", "for", "at", "in", "has"). Avoid literal mathematical connectors like "gives" or "plus".

## Strict Mechanical Constraints
- **Fodder Integrity:** Fodder must be physically present in the surface. No indirect anagrams or synonyms for raw letters.
- **Imperative Indicators:** Indicators preceding fodder must be commands (e.g., "Mix", "Break", "Return"), not descriptions (e.g., "Mixed", "Returns").
- **Anti-Gibberish (Masking):** Never use single letters or non-word prefixes (EN, Y, C) as standalone words. Mask them using the Top 50 Cryptic Abbreviations.
- **Real-Word Fodder:** In reversals or containers, the fodder itself should ideally be a real English word to maintain surface quality. Reject non-words like "nettab".

## Reference Standards
- **GOLD (Minimalist):** "Dormitory: Confused dirty room (9)".
- **GOLD (Narrative):** "How illusionist disguises a dead giveaway? (4)".
- **FAIL (Bloated):** "Majestic bearing when lager returned" (Redundant "bearing when").
- **FAIL (Literal/Dry):** "Earnest request with en, treat, y" (Gibberish and literal).

## Forbidden Patterns
- **STANDALONE NON-WORDS:** Standalone fodder must be a dictionary-valid word. No random letter strings permitted in the surface. Every piece of fodder must be defensible via standard English dictionaries (Oxford, Merriam-Webster, etc.).
  - **FORBIDDEN (Reversal):** "AMHTSA brought back" → ASTHMA (amhtsa is gibberish)
  - **FORBIDDEN (Container):** "NETTAB contains en" → BATTEN (nettab is gibberish)
  - **REQUIRED:** "Lager returned" → REGAL (both lager and regal are real words)
  - **MECHANISM PIVOT:** If reversing the answer produces a non-word, MUST choose a different clue type (Charade, Hidden Word, Anagram)
- **LITERAL LETTER LISTINGS:** "with n, e, w" or "from a, b, c" (use narrative masking with Top 50 abbreviations)
- **SYNONYM FODDER:** Definition or fodder words must appear literally in surface, not as synonyms
- **DIRECTIONAL INDICATORS:** No down-only terms like "rising", "up", "lifted" (horizontal clues only)
- **FILLER BLOAT:** Maximum 1-2 connector words; every word must serve cryptic purpose
