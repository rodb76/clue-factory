The setter is banking on you thinking of just one meaning at first, perhaps 'argument', but the answer seamlessly covers both interpretations. This is why Double Definition clues feel so satisfying once they click - they showcase how rich and flexible language can be, with one elegant word doing double duty to match both parts of the clue!"

In one sense, 'soft' or 'gentle' describes something TENDER (like tender feelings or tender skin). In another sense, a TENDER is a literal boat—specifically a small vessel that attends to a larger ship, supplying it or ferrying crew. The clue is wonderfully constructed because the surface reading (about a soft boat) almost makes sense, yet both meanings are completely legitimate dictionary definitions. That's the elegance of the double definition: no anagrams, no hidden words, no indicators—just one beautiful word doing double duty!"
